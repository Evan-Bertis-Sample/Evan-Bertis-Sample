###

I'm a student studying Computer Science at Northwestern University's McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science.
* ⌨️ I love developing video games, creating software tools, and writing firmware.
* 🚗 I am on Northwestern's Formula Team, where I work on the Data Aquisition Subteam.
* 🎮 I am a Full Stack Game Developer at Overture Games.
* 👨‍🔬 I am a web developer at Northwestern's CCL Lab, where I aid in the development of Morfli, a learning enviornment for Material Science.
* 🎨 In my freetime, I enjoy creating art and powerlifting (S:375, B:255, D:455).

## 🚧 Current Projects 🚧

Currently, I am working as QA Lead and game developer at [Overture Games](https://www.overture.games/). We are preparing to release the indie studio's first commerical release, Intervallic, a game that makes learning instruments fun!

Outside of Overture, I'm working on a lightweight framework/template for the Unity Game Engine, called [Curly](https://github.com/Evan-Bertis-Sample/Curly). Curly promises to make building small to medium-sized games easy, while promoting a solid architecture.
