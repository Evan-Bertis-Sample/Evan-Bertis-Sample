###

I'm a student studying Computer Science at Northwestern University's McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science.
* ⌨️ I love developing video games, creating software tools, and writing firmware.
* 🚗 I am on Northwestern's Formula Team, where I work on the Data Aquisition Subteam.
* 👨‍🔬 I am a web developer at Northwestern's CCL Lab, where I aid in the development of Morfli, a learning enviornment for Material Science.
* 🔺 My favorite field of programming is graphics programming, particularly stylized rendering.
* 🪄 Currently training to become a shader wizzard by reading the forbidden texts of graphics programming (the openGL api).
* 🎨 In my freetime, I enjoy creating art and powerlifting (S:385, B:265, D:455).
